# Netflix Ratings and Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

<strong>Netflix Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze ratings and votes across movies and shows by country, genre, and title. Key features included dynamic filters, KPI cards, gradient-based bar charts, and map visualizations for geographic insights. Integrated search and sorting capabilities, conditional formatting, and DAX calculations to enhance data exploration and storytelling. <strong>Tools used:</strong> Power BI, DAX, SQL, and advanced data modeling techniques.

## Data Preparation and Ingestion

I imported and transformed raw data from Excel, cleaned and standardized the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, renaming them for clarity, and handling missing values. I applied data profiling techniques to ensure data quality, addressed outliers, and filtered irrelevant records to create a reliable dataset for developing dynamic dashboards.
