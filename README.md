# Netflix Ratings and Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

<strong>Netflix Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze ratings and votes across movies and shows by country, genre, and title. Key features included dynamic filters, KPI cards, gradient-based bar charts, and map visualizations for geographic insights. Integrated search and sorting capabilities, conditional formatting, and DAX calculations to enhance data exploration and storytelling. <strong>Tools used:</strong> Power BI, DAX, SQL, and advanced data modeling techniques.

## Data Preparation and Ingestion

I imported and transformed raw data from Excel, cleaned and standardized the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, renaming them for clarity, and handling missing values. I applied data profiling techniques to ensure data quality, addressed outliers, and filtered irrelevant records to create a reliable dataset for developing dynamic dashboards.

## Data Model

I developed a robust data model by transforming raw datasets into meaningful dimensions and measures. Using DAX, I created calculated columns to classify data into groups like "Listing Type" and "Rating Groups" and cleaned data using dynamic formulas such as <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>SEARCH</strong>. I organized model elements into folders, optimized hidden fields for clarity, and validated calculated fields to ensure accurate outputs. These efforts streamlined the data modeling process, preparing the data for effective visualization and analysis.
